Let's start with a naive class:

```cpp
class Banana {
public:
    Banana(std::string s)
    {
	    s_ = s;
    }
private:
    std::string s_;
};
```

When instantiating a Banana like so:

```cpp
auto b = Banana("Bob");
```

When calling `Banana("Bob")`, you are making a copy inside the parameter `s` of the class
Before the constructor executes, `s_` is default constructed as an empty string.
The copy assignment operator (`s_ = s`) is called resulting in another copy.  
**We have 2 copies + 1 default construction.**

### Optimization 1: Use an initializer list

```cpp
class Banana {
public:
    Banana(std::string s) : s_(s) {}
private:
    std::string s_;
};
```

Now we directly initialize `s_` with `s`, which avoids the default construction of `s_`.
However, we are still using the copy constructor when initializing `s_`.
Also note that, we are also still creating a copy inside the parameter `s`.
We now have **2 copies**.

### Optimization 2: Use `std::move` to avoid unnecessary copies

This works for our use-case because we construct banana with an **rvalue**, hence allowing the string` s_` to be created without any copies, but rather with a move which is a lot less computationally expensive.

```cpp
class Banana {
public:
    Banana(std::string s) : s_(std::move(s)) {}
private:
    std::string s_;
};
```

**We now have 1 copy and 1 move.**

#### What happens the Banana is constructed with an lvalue?

If we construct `Banana` with an lvalue, then we have undefined behaviour for the variable `name`.

```cpp
std::string name{"Bob"};
auto b = Banana(name);
```

### Optimization 3: Use `std::forward` to handle both rvalues and lvalues

This method is a templated approach that takes in a universal reference consisting of either an rvalue or an lvalue, and handles construction accordingly.

```cpp
class Banana {
public:
    template <typename T>
    explicit Banana(T&& s) : s_(std::forward<T>(s)) {}
private:
    std::string s_;
};

```

The `std::forward` automatically calls the correct constructor given the type of input:

- If `s` is an rvalue, the move constructor is called.
- If `s` is an lvalue, the copy constructor is called. The copy constructor is used here because we do not want to leave the original lvalue in an undefined state.

Example usage:

```cpp
// Calls copy constructor, so we can still use name afterwards
std::string name{"Bob"};
auto b1 = Banana(name);

// Directly transfers ownership of "Bob" to the Banana object
auto b2 = Banana("Bob");
```

**If `s` is an rvalue, we have `1 move` and no copies.**
**If `s` is an lvalue, we have `1 copy`.**

Note: `explicit` just means that the compiler will fail if you don't pass in the exact type specified in the params. In other words, it prevents implicit conversions such as `char const*` to a `std::string`.
