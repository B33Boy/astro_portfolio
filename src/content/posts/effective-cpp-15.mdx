# Item 15: Use constexpr whenever possible

Key takeaways:

- `constexpr` objects are const and **initialized with values known at compile time**
- `constexpr` functions can produce compile-time results when called with arguments whose values are known during compilation
- `constexpr` objects and functions may be used in wider range of contexts than non-constexpr objects and functions
- `constexpr` is part of an object/function's interface

`constexpr` functions are will be evaluated at compile-time if all arguments are known, otherwise it will be treated like a normal function.

```cpp
constexpr int pow(int base, unsigned exp) noexcept {...}

constexpr auto numConds = 5;
std::array<int, pow(3, numConds)> results; // creates an array with 3^5 elements at compile-time

auto base = readfromDB(...);
auto exp = readFromDB(...);
auto p = pow(base, exp); // Regular run-time usage
```

### C++11 and C++14 restrictions for `constexpr` functions

In C++11, `constexpr` functions may contain no more than single return statement.
The workaround for that is ternary operators:

```cpp
constexpr int pow(int base, unsigned exp) noexcept
{
	return (exp == 0 ? 1 : base * pow(base, exp-1));
}
```

In C++14, you can do more computation before calling return.

### Getters

`constexpr` functions are limited to taking and returning literal types (i.e. non-trivial construction logic). This includes user defined types:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
	constexpr Point(double xVal = 0, double yVal = 0) noexcept : x(xVal), y(yVal){}

	constexpr double xValue() const noexcept { return x; }
	constexpr double yValue() const noexcept { return y; }

	void setX(double newX) noexcept { x = newX; }
	void setY(double newY) noexcept { y = newY; }
private:
	double x, y;
};
```

So this way you can declare an object of the class as a `constexpr` (e.g. `constexpr Point p1(1, 2);`)

### C++11 and C++14 restrictions for `constexpr` member functions

In C++11, two restrictions prevent Point’s member functions `setX` and `setY` from being declared `constexpr`.

- First, they modify the object they operate on, and in **C++11, `constexpr` member functions are implicitly const.**
- Second, they have void return types, and void isn’t a literal type in C++11.

Both these restrictions are lifted in C++14, so in C++14, even Point’s setters can be `constexpr`:

```cpp
class Point
{
public:
	constexpr void setX(double newX) noexcept
	{ x = newX; }

	constexpr void setY(double newY) noexcept
	{ y = newY; }
};
```
