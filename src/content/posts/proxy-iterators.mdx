I regularly use range-based for loops (e.g. `auto& e : elements`) for direct access to each element in a container. However I recently came across the following issue:

```cpp
std::vector<bool> vec{true, false, true, true};
for (auto& v : vec)
{
	// Modify v below
	v = !v;
	std::cout << v << " ";
}
// error: cannot bind non-const lvalue reference of type ‘std::_Bit_reference&’ to an rvalue of type ‘std::_Bit_iterator::reference’

```

It turns out that `std::vector<bool>` is a specialized template that packs boolean values into bits rather than storing each as a separate `bool`. Because individual bits cannot be referenced directly, `std::vector<bool>` provides a proxy type called `std::vector<bool>::reference` instead of a real `bool&`. `auto&` here expects a real reference, which is not provided. The workaround for this is to use the universal reference `auto&&` to bind correctly to the proxy reference :

```c++
for (auto&& v : vec)
{
	// Modify v below
	v = !v;
	std::cout << v << " ";
}
```
