I was exploring ways to avoid dynamic dispatch and improve performance using templates.
One common use case is when a class has long-lived dependencies that can be fixed at compile time. For example, consider a class `Foo` that persists throughout the lifetime of the program, where its dependencies are not expected to be swapped out at runtime.

In this case, instead of using runtime polymorphism (i.e. with virtual functions), we can inject dependencies as template params.

If class `Foo` should take full ownership of the injected dependencies, passing `std::unique_ptr` and calling `std::move` would be more appropriate. However, in this example, we use reference injection for simplicity and testability.

```cpp title="dep.h"
class Dep
{
public:
	void some_func()
	{
		// Some implementation here
	}
};
```

```cpp title="foo.h"
template <class Dep>
class Foo
{
public:
	Foo(Dep& dep) : dep_(dep) {}

	do_something()
	{
		dep_.some_func();
	}

private:
	Dep& dep_;
};
```

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include "foo.h"
int main()
{
	Dep dep;
	Foo<Dep> foo(dep);
	foo.do_something();
}
```

This method injects a reference to a dependency into a class. **It is important to note that the class doesn't own the dependency.** This is useful when it comes to testing where you can mock the dependency without worrying about managing its lifetime.

```cpp title="foo_test.cpp"
#include <gtest.h>
#include <gmock.h>

#include "foo.h"

class Mock_Dep
{
public:
	MOCK_METHOD(void, some_func, ());
};

TEST(foo_test, FooUsesDep)
{
  // Arrange
  Mock_Dep dep;
  Foo<Dep> foo(dep);

  // Assert/Act
  EXPECT_CALL(dep, some_func()).Times(1);
  foo.do_something();
}

```
