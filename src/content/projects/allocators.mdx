A collection of custom memory allocator implementations for C++ designed to be compatible with STL containers and provide alternative allocation strategies (e.g., bump/linear allocators) with a clean, minimal API. 
The project includes examples demonstrating usage patterns and is buildable with CMake for cross‑platform experimentation and benchmarking. 
It’s focused on giving hands‑on experience with allocator design, memory management patterns beyond new/delete, and integration with modern C++ codebases.
