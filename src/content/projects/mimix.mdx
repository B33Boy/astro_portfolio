This project started from a simple idea: what would it be like to argue with myself?
I set out to build a basic Discord bot powered by an LLM that could learn from my past messages and respond in a similar way.
It mimics the user's messages using a local LLM and vector similarity search via ChromaDB, enabling personalized, context-aware conversations
