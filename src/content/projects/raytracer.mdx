- Built a modular ray tracer in Modern C++ (RAII, smart pointers, constexpr, templates) with a clean separation between math, geometry, and rendering logic.
- Designed a cross-platform CMake build system with compiler-specific scripts (gcc/clang), target-based configuration, and integrated testing via CTest.
- Applied professional C++ tooling practices including .clang-format, unit tests, and structured project layout to improve maintainability and scalability.
