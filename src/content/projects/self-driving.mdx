This summer, after completing Stanford University's Machine Learning MOOC on Coursera, I sought hands-on experience through a side project. 
I chose to recreate [Hamuchiwa's AutoRCCar](https://github.com/hamuchiwa/AutoRCCar) project and implemented my own neural network using the Python library Keras. 
Learning Keras was made significantly easier by reading [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python).

## Overview
The Raspberry Pi is responsible for obtaining distance data from the sensors, and images from the PiCamera. 
The Raspberry Pi then sends this data to the laptop using TCP/IP. 
At the laptop, image processing is done and the trained deep learning model makes a prediction on what button to press in the form of a one-hot-encoded array (e.g. `[0 0 1]` to move right). 
The laptop then sends instructions to the Arduino which is interfaced with the RC controller to send the signal to move.

## Deep Learning
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
With the limitations of my RC car, training was a made a lot more difficult. 
The turning radius of the car prevented me from training on a circular track. 
Thus, I had to train on a linear track, resulting in having to manually pick up the car to bring it back to the staring line. 
By the end of the training, I had  gathered about 1000 samples, yet it still wasn't enough. 
So, I used a trick I learned from the Machine Learning MOOC to generate more data by flipping all the images and labels in the x direction.

### Building The Model
The next step was to actually build the Keras model. We first split the data into training and testing sets. Our model consists of 3 Dense layers, but we add some Dropout between layers to prevent the model from picking up random patterns. The final activation is a softmax function which is necessary for our multi-label classification problem.

### Fit The Model
